### 🏠 [Homepage](https://github.com/MarkLGershman/Cards#readme)

## Prerequisites

-   node >=10.0.0

## Install

```sh
npm install
```

## Usage

```sh
npm run build-client && npm start
```

## Development
This is how you work on this project

### Front-End

Run `npm run client-dev` at the root, that will start the create-react-app development server.

### Backend

Run `npm run backend-dev` at the root, that will build the react client then start the backend.

### Front-End + Backend

You *can* work on the front and back end at the same time by running `npm run full-dev` at the root but they will be running in different ports, therefore not interacting with each other.

## Run tests

```sh
npm run test
```
